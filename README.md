# EcoSync Enterprise Digital Twin

EcoSync is a high-performance Digital Twin platform designed to bridge Building Information Modeling (BIM) data with real-time SCADA/HVAC telemetry. It features a lightweight React/Three.js frontend and a heavy-duty Go backend that runs physical thermodynamic simulations and streams state via WebSockets.

## 🚀 Development Process & Architecture

During **Sprint 1 (Core Architecture & Simulation)**, we built a robust and highly scalable foundation:

1. **High-Performance Telemetry Streaming (Go & FlatBuffers)**
   - Replaced basic JSON polling with a persistent WebSocket connection.
   - Integrated Google FlatBuffers to serialize the simulation state into a compact binary format, allowing the backend to stream building data at a flawless 30 FPS without choking the network or browser memory.

2. **Thermodynamic Physics Engine (Go)**
   - Built a custom simulation engine (`engine.go`) that models thermal mass (`CWall`, `CAir`), thermal resistance (`RIn`, `ROut`), and internal heat loads (people/servers).
   - Implemented a Hardy Cross network solver to calculate dynamic airflow based on VAV damper resistances and AHU pressure.
   - The engine correctly balances external weather, internal heat, and HVAC cooling capacity to reach realistic thermal equilibriums.

3. **3D Visualization Engine (React Three Fiber)**
   - Created a 3D rendering pipeline that dynamically generates multi-story floor plates and thermal zones based on geometric polygons defined in `building-data.json`.
   - Built a custom GLSL Shader using a `smoothstep` heatmap to smoothly and dynamically color the 3D zones based on real-time temperature deviation from the setpoint.

4. **2D P&ID Topology Mapping (React Flow)**
   - Mapped the HVAC systems (AHUs, VAVs, Zones) into an interactive 2D node graph using React Flow.
   - Applied smooth CSS transitions matching the 3D GLSL shader to provide consistent, jitter-free visual feedback across the entire application.

5. **AI Auto-Pilot & Fault Scenarios**
   - Implemented interactive Scenarios (Peak Load, Critical Fault).
   - The "Critical Fault" triggers a 5x thermal runaway in the server room by dynamically throttling VAV airflow.
   - The "AI Auto-Pilot" detects the thermal anomaly and issues a SCADA override script to aggressively route cooling to the core, successfully stabilizing the building.

6. **Advanced Telemetry Analytics & AI Insights**
   - Built a sleek Left Dock Navigation supporting toggleable tabs for **AI Insights** and **Telemetry Logs**.
   - **Dynamic Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** AI Insights accurately diagnoses the fault target, predicting the blast radius and cause (e.g., "CRAC unit compressor failure" for server rooms, "VAV damper stuck" for offices).
   - **Thermodynamic Characteristic Chart:** A real-time auto-scaling Recharts scatter plot showing CO₂ vs Power. The live telemetry dots dynamically follow the ideal thermodynamic slope under normal conditions, but violently break away from the baseline during injected faults to visibly demonstrate anomalies.
   - **Live Terminal Logging:** The Telemetry Logs tab renders a hacker-style real-time terminal of up to 30 active zones, showcasing live temperatures, loads, and occupancy streaming directly from the WASM engine.

7. **Mobile UI Adaptation (Tesla-Style)**
   - Designed a responsive `MobileApp.jsx` interface imitating the Tesla app layout for rapid macro-level facility monitoring.
   - Implemented `100dvh` (Dynamic Viewport Height) logic for iOS Safari support to ensure smooth native scrolling and safe-area padding underneath the browser's dynamic address bar.
   - Built bottom-drawer drill-downs to allow tapping on zones and revealing live telemetry metrics without leaving the 3D map context.

## 🚧 Current Limitations & Challenges

### 1. Mobile 3D Scaling & React Three Fiber Strict Mode
- **Challenge:** Adapting the desktop 3D `BuildingModel` for mobile viewports required dynamically passing `isMobile` props deeply through nested components (`FloorPlate`, `ZoneRenderer`). 
- **Limitation:** React Three Fiber's event system and Canvas error boundaries are extremely sensitive to undefined variables. Aggressively injecting responsive props caused fatal WebGL unmounting in strict mode, necessitating careful prop-drilling or Context API usage to prevent UI regressions on desktop.
- **UI Clipping:** Ensuring floating `<Html>` labels in the 3D scene do not overlap native CSS overlay menus on smaller screens requires manual z-index and conditional rendering management.

While our recent sprints successfully proved the core architecture, 3D visualizations, and interactive IoT drill-downs, several critical features remain unimplemented before the platform is ready for production.

### 1. Historical Data & Predictive Forecasting
- **Forecasting (Allocated to Team):** The data science team is currently allocated to handle time-series forecasting, building out historical data ingestion pipelines (batch-inserting 30FPS FlatBuffers into TimescaleDB), and rendering predictive analytics charts.
- **Current State:** The `docker-compose.yml` initializes a `timescaledb` (PostgreSQL) container, but the Go backend does not yet write telemetry data to it. The frontend currently streams live ephemeral data.
- **Missing:** REST or GraphQL API endpoints to query the historical downsampled data being generated by the forecasting team.

### 2. Advanced Capabilities & Security
- **Semantic Mapping Layer:** Missing a mechanism to automatically bind BIM GUIDs (Asset IDs) to their corresponding SCADA telemetry tags (e.g., BACnet IP endpoints, Modbus registers).
- **Machine Learning Inference:** The "AI Auto-Pilot" currently relies on hardcoded thresholds (e.g., `temp > 25.0`) to trigger remediation. This needs to be replaced with an actual ML model (e.g., PyTorch via a Python microservice) that predicts thermal anomalies based on historical weather, occupancy, and HVAC degradation.
- **Security & Authentication:** WebSockets and API endpoints are completely open. Missing JWT authentication, WSS (Secure WebSockets), and proper CORS configurations for production deployment.

## 🛠️ How to Run (Detailed Guide)

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** Required to run the Go backend and TimescaleDB containers.
- **Node.js (v18+):** Required to build and run the React/Vite frontend.
- **npm or yarn:** Package manager for Node.js.

### 1. Starting the Backend (Go Simulation Engine)
The backend runs the thermodynamic simulation, serves the building data, and streams WebSocket telemetry.

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Build and start the Go backend and PostgreSQL database in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build

# Verify the containers are running
docker ps
# You should see two containers: 'server-server-1' (Port 8080) and 'server-db-1' (Port 5432)

# (Optional) Follow the backend logs to see incoming WebSocket connections
docker logs -f server-server-1
```
*Note: The Go backend runs on `http://localhost:8080`. The WebSocket endpoint is at `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.*

### 2. Starting the Frontend (React Dashboard)
The frontend connects to the local Go backend to render the 3D map and interactive topology.

```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to the dashboard directory
cd dashboard

# Install all Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Accessing the Application
- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite provides in your terminal).
- You should immediately see the 3D building render and the topology map populate with live temperature data streaming from the Go backend.

### 4. Testing the Backend via CLI Dashboard
For backend testing and telemetry debugging, you can use the standalone Go CLI Dashboard (htop-style).
```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to the CLI directory
cd server/cli

# Run the CLI dashboard
go run dashboard.go
```
*Note: The CLI dashboard dynamically sorts the hottest thermal zones to the top of your terminal and natively reads the high-speed FlatBuffers binary stream.*

### 5. Running the Autonomous DeepFloorplan Scanner
The `ai_modules/branch_b_digitization/deepfloorplan` directory contains a Streamlit app to autonomously digitize any architectural blueprint.
```bash
# Navigate to the DeepFloorplan directory
cd ai_modules/branch_b_digitization/deepfloorplan

# Install dependencies (if you haven't already)
pip install streamlit opencv-python networkx

# Run the Streamlit UI
streamlit run app.py
```
*Note: The AI will autonomously grid-search OpenCV parameters to mathematically derive the Space Syntax Dual Graph of the blueprint.*

### Troubleshooting
- **Frontend isn't receiving data?** Ensure the backend is running and port `8080` is not blocked. Check the browser console (F12) for WebSocket connection errors.
- **Docker port conflict?** If port `8080` or `5432` is already in use by another application on your machine, stop the conflicting application or map different ports in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
